Bernoulli's theorem statse sthat within a horizontal flow of fluid, points of
higher fluid speed will have less pressure than points of slower fluid speed

# The Equation

## K = p + 1/2p*v^2 + pgh

K = constant
P = pressure of the fluid at a the point of measurement
p = rho - the density of the fluid at the point of measurement
v = velocity
g = acceleration due to gravity
h = height or elevation from a reference point

## What the equation says

Since matter and energy can neither be created or destroyed, there must be conservation happening at a given point when a fluid changes velocity. In a horizontal laminar flow, this happens my modulating the pressure of the fluid. I.E. when a fluid is moving faster, the pressure will be lower, and vice versa. Therefore the total energy at a given point of measurement will always be equal to the constant K - in other words, every point measured will have the same totaly energy and mass.
